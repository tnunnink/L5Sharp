/// This is the base class for all logix component classes. All components can be identified by a unique name that
/// is typically subject to some naming constraints defined by a Rockwell. Logix internally may create
/// components that do not adhere to the naming constraints, which is why the property is a simple string.
/// Names should be unique any attempt to create duplicated names should fail.
/// All components also contain a simple string description and <see cref="Core.Use"/> to identify the

/// All components also contain some common functionality, such as the ability to find dependencies and references, and
/// to be exported individually as a new L5X component file. The default equality implementation is also overridden
/// to determine equality by the component type, name, and scope within the L5X tree.
